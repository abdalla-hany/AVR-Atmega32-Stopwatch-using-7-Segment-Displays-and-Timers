# AVR Atmega32 Stopwatch

This project implements a stopwatch using an AVR Atmega32 microcontroller, 7-segment displays, and timers. The stopwatch provides functionalities to start, stop, pause, and resume timing.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you will need the following:
- AVR Atmega32 microcontroller
- 7-segment displays
- Development environment (e.g., Eclipse IDE, proteus simulator)

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary development environment and toolchain set up to compile and flash the code onto the AVR Atmega32 microcontroller.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred AVR development environment.
3. Compile the code and flash it onto the AVR Atmega32 microcontroller.
4. You can run the simulation using proteus simulator.

## Usage

1. Connect the 7-segment displays to the appropriate pins of the AVR Atmega32 microcontroller.
2. Ensure the external buttons for controlling the stopwatch are connected to the designated interrupt pins.
3. Power on the microcontroller.
4. The stopwatch will display time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
5. Use the external buttons to start, stop, pause, and resume timing as desired.

## Features

- Displays time in hours, minutes, and seconds on 7-segment displays.
- Utilizes interrupts for external buttons to control stopwatch functionalities.
- Allows starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming timing operations.
